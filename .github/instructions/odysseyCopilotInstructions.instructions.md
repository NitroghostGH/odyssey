Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and files. This will help in generating relevant code snippets and understanding the context.

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for the specific programming languages and frameworks used in the project. This includes naming conventions, file organization, and code formatting.

3. **Documentation**: Refer to existing documentation, comments, and README files within the project to gain insights into the intended functionality and usage of different components.

4. **Testing**: Emphasize the importance of testing and provide guidance on writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as applicable to the project.

5. **Security**: Be aware of security considerations and potential vulnerabilities in the code. Follow secure coding practices and recommend security measures where necessary.

6. **Performance**: Consider performance implications when generating code. Suggest optimizations and efficient algorithms where applicable.

7. **Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration and communication among team members. Provide guidance on code reviews, pull requests, and other collaborative practices.

8. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with the latest developments in relevant technologies and frameworks. Encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the team.

9. **Run tests**: Always run existing tests after making changes to ensure that new code does not break existing functionality.

10. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure that issues can be diagnosed and resolved efficiently.

11. **Version Control**: Use version control effectively, including meaningful commit messages and proper branching strategies.

12. **User Experience**: Consider the user experience when generating code for front-end components. Ensure that the UI is intuitive and accessible.

By following these guidelines, AI can effectively assist developers in creating high-quality code that aligns with the project's goals and standards.
